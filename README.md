# Basic-Tutorial-Structure
A sample tutorial structure to start with. The basic structure is a parent folder with two directories: notebooks and
literature. Notebooks will contain jupyter notebooks and R Markdown files which provide code tutorials for the
repository. The literature folder contains synopses and DOI links for papers of interest to these tutorials. Finally an
environment.yml file defines a conda environment that is used for the notebooks.

This README.md file should define what is the goal to be covered in the tutorial as well as a TODO to define what should
 be done.
 
 ### TODO:
 - Define what should and shouldn't be in a tutorial
 - Try to define a general scope for a single tutorial
 - Beg students to think of what tutorials they would like to see
